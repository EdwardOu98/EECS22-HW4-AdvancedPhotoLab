This program is an updated version of assignment 3, in which the arrays of color
 channels are changed into structures and three more filters are added. The 
three new filters are: Rotate, Resize, and Saturate. They are implemented 
according to the given algorithms. 
Rotate: according to the choise made by the user, the function will either flip
or rotate the image. 
Resize: this function will resize the image according to the user's input
percentage. When input is greater than 100.00, the function will enlarge the 
image. When input is less than 100.00, the function will shrink the image. 
Saturate: this function will change the saturation of an image. It reads user's
input for precentage of saturation.
